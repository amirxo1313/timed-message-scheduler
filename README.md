# Project Name

## Project Overview
This project is a web application that leverages a Python backend and a JavaScript frontend to allow users to schedule timed messages. The application consists of an integrated server, a client interface, and utility functions to facilitate communication and message processing.

## Installation
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python installed. Use `pip` to install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **(If applicable) Install JavaScript dependencies:**
   If you have a `package.json` file, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Python server:**
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

5. **Open the `index.html` in your web browser to access the application.**

## Usage
Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (or the relevant port). You will be presented with a user interface to schedule your messages. Follow the prompts on the screen to input your message and schedule settings.

## Features
- Schedule timed messages through an intuitive web interface.
- Backend processing with Python to handle scheduling and message management.
- User-friendly design with responsive HTML and styled with CSS for a better user experience.

## Dependencies
### Python Dependencies
- Flask (Assumed for server.py)
- Schedule (Assumed for message scheduling)
- Any other relevant packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

### JavaScript Dependencies
If you are using a `package.json`, typical dependencies may include libraries like:
- React
- Express
- Axios
- etc.

(Please replace this section with actual dependencies if the `package.json` file exists.)
